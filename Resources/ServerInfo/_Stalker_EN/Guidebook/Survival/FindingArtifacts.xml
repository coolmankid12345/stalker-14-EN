# Finding Artifacts

Artifacts are strange objects born from the Zone's anomalies. Traders pay well for them, and some stalkers risk everything to collect them.

## Two Tools, Two Purposes

Rookies often confuse these devices. Don't make that mistake.

### Anomaly Detectors

These warn you when danger is near. The beeping gets faster as you approach an anomaly. They keep you alive, but they [color=red]won't help you find artifacts[/color].

### Artifact Detectors

These locate artifacts hidden inside anomaly fields. Without one, you're searching blind.

## How to Hunt Artifacts

[bullet] Equip an artifact detector and hold it ready

[bullet] Approach anomaly fields carefully

[bullet] Listen for the signal - faster beeps mean you're closer

[bullet] Find the artifact and grab it before something else finds you

## A Word from Veterans

Not all detectors are equal. Cheap models only pick up common artifacts. If you want the rare stuff, you'll need better equipment. Ask around, or find out the hard way.
