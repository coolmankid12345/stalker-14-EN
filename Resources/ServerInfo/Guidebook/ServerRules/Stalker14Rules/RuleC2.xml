  # Core Rule 2 - Do not RDM without good reason and without being in the proper zone

  In most scenarios, you should not be shooting/attacking people as soon as you see them. However, there are zones where player versus player (PVP) is allowed.
  Robbing and looting should also not be your first go to but this will also be explained more later. PVP should also not be done near transitions to other regions.
  You should be at least three screens away from a green zone to initiate PVP or robbing. Camping a transition will be punished severely.
