  # Core Rule 5 - Do not make new characters or change your name

  You're supposed to be commiting to a character. Initially, there was a feature that only allowed you one save for a character but I didn't feel like having to give people
  a second try every time they messed up their character creation. You can change hairstyles, tattoos, and other marks but you shouldn't be becoming a whole different person.
  New characters or name changes should be approved by an admin before you commit to it.
