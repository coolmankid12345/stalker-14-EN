  # Core Rule 7 - Faction specific rules and wars

  Factions at war are allowed to shoot each other on sight outside of [color=#008000]Green Zones[/color]. Some factions are locked in perpetual war and will never be changed, same
  applies for some alliances. Other wars and alliances are determined by the faction leaders. Wearing the armor of a faction without having your badge on will allow others to identify
  you as that faction and can shoot you if they are at war with that faction so maybe have your badge on while wearing Bandit armor.

  Faction members should not handing out exclusive faction gear willy nilly without permission from the faction lead. This is especially true for factions that spawn with free kits
  like Military and Monolith.

  Note. All factions are at war with Monolith.

  If your faction is not listed here, then you have no specific faction rules or perpetual wars/alliances and should follow your leader's rules. You should also follow your leader's rules even if you have rules here
  too.
