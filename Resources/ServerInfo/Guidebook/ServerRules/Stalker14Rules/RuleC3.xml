  # Core Rule 3 - No metagaming or cheating

  Self-explanatory, I think. Don't use outside software to gain an unfair advantage and don't use information your character wouldn't know otherwise. I also don't recommend watching
  a Stalker 14 EN stream while playing on the server yourself, not matter how fire it might be.

  Do not abuse bugs that would also give you an unfair advantage. Like a money duplication glitch.
