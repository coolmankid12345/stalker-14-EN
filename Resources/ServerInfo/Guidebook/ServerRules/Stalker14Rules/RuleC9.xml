  # Core Rule 9 - Factions

  ## General Faction Rules

  Factions at war are allowed to shoot each other on sight outside of [color=#008000]Green Zones[/color]. Some factions are locked in perpetual war and will never change; the same applies for some alliances. Other wars and alliances are determined by faction leaders. Note: All factions are at war with [textlink="Monolith" link="RuleF4"].

  Faction members should not hand out exclusive faction gear without permission from the faction lead. This is especially true for factions that spawn with free kits like the Military and Monolith. Faction members should also not let non-faction members see or use their shops without permission from their leader.

  When traveling in a group, if a member of your group is of a different faction and is being shot at by a member of one of their rival factions, you are allowed to assist your group member if you wish.

  Factions are required to roleplay as the faction they are playing. The leader must ensure that recruits have at least a basic understanding of the faction's lore and playstyle. This is to maintain an interactive experience.

  Faction leaders are held to a higher standard of roleplay and should maintain their faction's rules and check on their subordinates.

  If your faction is not listed here, then you have no specific faction rules or perpetual wars/alliances and should follow your leader's rules. You should also follow your leader's rules even if you have rules here. Leader rules should not overwrite faction rules.

  ## Alliances and Wars

  When factions come to a situation that will change faction relations, there must be an administrator present or proof of roleplay interaction. Administration will use this to determine if it is grounds to approve or deny your request. You can message senior administrators in your faction's channel.

  Senior Administrators (Host, Head Administrators) may ONLY make alterations to the faction relations chart. Once approved, a senior administrator will give the leader of the faction access to the appropriate channel to make an official declaration of war or alliance in the Discord and in-character.

  Some wars or alliances MAY be done without roleplay if there has been substantial evidence to prove reasonable cause, as long as senior administrators see fit.
