  # Core Rule 8 - Robbing and Looting

  When engaging in interactions that involve robbing, kidnapping, or searching another player, you must clearly speak in English. You are allowed to use other languages in casual settings, however this is an English server. It is unfair to players who have no idea what you are asking or demanding.

  Being robbed is something you will likely encounter often, as [textlink="Bandits" link="RuleF1"] and [textlink="Renegades" link="RuleF2"] frequently patrol the Zone. These rules apply to all factions — individual factions may have additional robbing rules in their [textlink="faction pages" link="RuleC9Stalker"].

  ## General Rules

  - Nobody should be robbing fresh-across-the-border Loners. If they have a Stalker Jacket and a TOZ or one of the two starter kits, they are most likely brand new. Robbing them is pointless and not fun for the person getting robbed, as they will end up with nothing. Instead, consider setting up checkpoints and charging entrance fees or protection money.
  - When robbing a player, if they actively resist or make it difficult (constantly breaking restraints, trying to run, being overly uncooperative), you may put them into a critical state. However, you should use meds to revive them. If you have to revive more than twice, you are allowed to kill them — in this case, AHELPing problem behavior is encouraged. Resistance breaches the rules for Roleplay Standards, Fear Roleplay, and Suicide when captured.
  - Anyone being robbed should at least be left with enough gear to reach a safe zone without dying to mutants on the way back.

  ## Zone Restrictions

  - No robbing or looting should take place in a [color=#008000]Green Zone[/color]. This includes SSD players.
  - You are allowed to loot dead people outside of [color=#008000]Green Zones[/color], but you are not allowed to watch someone die and then proceed to loot them. Given the opportunity, you should attempt to rescue them unless the situation is too dangerous to handle (e.g., heavily irradiated area, anomaly field with no protection, horde of dangerous mutants).

  ## Faction Gear

  Faction members catching a non-faction member wearing their gear is grounds to rob said individual. However, they should only confiscate the faction's exclusive gear or armor, unless the person resists — then anything is fair game. Factions are allowed to rob [textlink="Renegades" link="RuleF2"] and [textlink="Bandits" link="RuleF1"] if they are not allied with them and can confirm they are a member of those factions.

  ## Who Can Rob

  Loners are only allowed to rob people when accompanied by [textlink="Bandits" link="RuleF1"] or [textlink="Renegades" link="RuleF2"].
