  # Renegades

  The Renegades are outcast stalkers too brutal for the Bandits, too unstable for Freedom, and too dangerous for anyone else. Once part of larger factions, they were driven out for insubordination, violence, or betrayal. What's left is a collection of bitter survivors united only by their hatred of authority and their will to endure.

  To outsiders, they're little more than madmen with guns. But to those who've faced them, they're a reminder that the Zone doesn't forgive — it just spits out what it can't consume. Praise the flesh!

  Renegades are allowed to rob anyone as long as they follow [textlink="Rule 5 - Character & Roleplay" link="RuleC5Stalker"] and [textlink="Rule 1 - Don't be an Asshole" link="RuleC1Stalker"]. When robbing, they should only take a percentage of the gear, with the leader being able to take more. Renegades should take even less than Bandits as you have the option to pull teeth. However, someone who resists is fair game to be looted completely, if you can catch them. Renegades caught robbing someone are allowed to be killed by whoever caught them. See [textlink="Rule 8 - Robbing and Looting" link="RuleC8Stalker"] for full robbery rules.
