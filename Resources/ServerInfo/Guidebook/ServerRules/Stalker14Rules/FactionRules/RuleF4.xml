  # Monolith

  Monolith are hostile to everyone, however, they should not be making it their goal to run as fast as possible to Cordon and shoot everyone they see. Monolith should patrol the Northern
  regions and move south if they can't find anyone. Monolith should not be shooting Loners who look like they just crossed the border.
  Monolith looking for on-sight combat should always be wearing their armor and have their badge on. Monolith should also not be looting Stalkers for all their gear as they would not have a need for it, you can however
  loot artifacts as those belong to the Monolith or ammo to help continue their Crusade.

  Wars:

  Alliances:
