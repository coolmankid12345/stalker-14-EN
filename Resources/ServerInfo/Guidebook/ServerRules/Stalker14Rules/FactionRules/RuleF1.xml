  # Bandits

  Bandits are allowed to rob anyone as long as they follow rule 6. When robbing people they should only take a percentage of the gear they have with the leader being
  able to take more gear. However, someone who resists is fair game to be looted completely, if you can catch them that is. Bandits caught robbing someone are allowed to be killed
  by whoever caught them.

  Wars:
