  # Bandits

  The Bandits are the scum of the Zone, thieves and extortionists who prey on anyone unlucky enough to wander into their territory. Most are former criminals, deserters, or drifters who found the Zone's lawlessness appealing. What they lack in discipline, they make up for in numbers and cruelty.

  Despite their reputation, the Bandits play a vital role in the Zone's black market. They supply weapons, ammo, and "protection" to those who can pay. Cross them, and you might end up stripped of everything — or worse.

  Bandits are allowed to rob anyone as long as they follow [textlink="Rule 5 - Character & Roleplay" link="RuleC5Stalker"] and [textlink="Rule 1 - Don't be an Asshole" link="RuleC1Stalker"]. When robbing, they should only take a percentage of the gear, with the leader being able to take more. However, someone who resists is fair game to be looted completely, if you can catch them. Bandits caught robbing someone are allowed to be killed by whoever caught them. See [textlink="Rule 8 - Robbing and Looting" link="RuleC8Stalker"] for full robbery rules.
