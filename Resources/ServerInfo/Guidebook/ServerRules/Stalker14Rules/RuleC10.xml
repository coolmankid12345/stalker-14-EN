  # Core Rule 10 - You're Going to Die. A lot.

  Less of a rule, more of a fact. The Zone is very unpredictable, death is inevitable, and that's okay. You are going to lose stuff — it's part of the game. If you lose all your money while starting out, an admin can give you more, just AHELP it.

  Remember, it's just a game. None of this is real. We try to help people when they're about to die because we know losing stuff sucks, but we can't help every time. You'll have to accept the fact that you're probably going to step on an anomaly and die, and that's okay.
