  # Core Rule 6 - Robbing and looting

  Being robbed is probably something you will run into quite often as Bandits and Renegades often patrol the zone, however, there are rules that they should follow.
  Factions will have different robbing rules that will be explained in the next rule. These are rules that apply for all factions.

  Nobody should be robbing fresh across the border Loners. If they have a Stalker Jacket and a TOZ more likely than not they are brand new and robbing them is pointless
  and not fun for the guy getting robbed as he will actually end up with nothing. Instead, however they can set up checkpoints like at the entrance to Garbage and make them pay for entry/protection.

  No robbing or looting should be taking place in a [color=#008000]Green Zone[/color]. This includes those that are SSD. You are allowed to loot dead people outside of [color=#008000]Green Zones[/color] but
  you are not allowed to watch someone die and then proceed to loot them. Given the opportunity, you should attempt to rescue them unless the situation the dying person is in
  is way too dangerous for you to handle (EX. Heavily irradiated area or anomaly field with no protection, horde of dangerous mutants).

  Faction members catching a non-faction member wearing their gear is a reason to rob said individual. However, they should only be confiscating the faction exclusive gear like armor
  unless they resist the attempt to have the gear confiscated then all their stuff is fair game. Factions are allowed to rob Renegades and Bandits if they are not allied with them and if they can confirm
  they are a member of those factions.

  Loners are allowed to rob people outside of Cordon unless they are trying to be recruited by a bandit faction.

  Anyone being robbed should AT LEAST be left enough gear to reach a safe zone without dying to mutants on the way back.
