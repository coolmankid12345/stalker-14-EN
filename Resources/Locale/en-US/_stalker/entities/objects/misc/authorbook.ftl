     {"[head=1]"}Epilogue[/head]
     Dear stalkers, this collection was created primarily so that the Zone would be less dangerous and unknown. Be kinder to each other: once at the beginning of my journey, I was helped more than once; now at the end of my journey, I have released a book and saved countless other stalkers throughout my life. Remember: you help now, and later they will help you. Carry kindness, understanding, and remember — the Zone is dangerous, it always seeks to set you up and kill you, despite all its beauty. With love, Ms Student♥.
