                                                INTRODUCTION

          This book is not just a reference book or guide, it is a set of rules and instructions that will help you survive in this dangerous world . Here you will find not only survival tips, but also stories about what awaits you in the most remote corners of the Zone, what secrets it holds, and what tests you will have to go through.

        Power is in knowledge, power in weapons, the power is in you, Stalker!

        Sincerely, Nikolay Khurmenko and the IC News office

                                                   Chapter 2
                                               Cache and Purgatory
          Purgatory - your journey always begins here. You have two options: go to the village or to the dressing room. To get to the village, you need to go into the right passage (with a stalker patch). Go through it and you are in the village.
          Below there will be a transition to the dressing room, on the left there will be a transition to the "shop", there will be a cache, on the right there is a transition to the "hospital" from the hospital you need to get out and go up until you reach a pedestrian crossing (the one with two stripes) further you must turn right and go up, there will be a store on the left and a transition to the cache on the right.
          There is one last crossing left, the one in the middle called the "station." There you need to exit the station and run to the right along the road. Then you need to find a hospital and walk up from it to the first pedestrian crossing. Then turn right and go up.

          So, you have arrived in the city of Chernobyl-4. And here the question arises: "What should I do now?"
          To begin with, I suggest you familiarize yourself with your place of residence - the Cache.
          The cache contains everything you need for life. Bathroom, bedroom and most importantly - the blue machine.
          He is the only one who will keep your things safe and sound. But with a small caveat. They don’t just shove things into it. There is a button "E" on the machine, which you need to press, and then put things away.

          There is a sink in the bathroom, but it is empty (thanks to the mayor). And the most important invention of mankind is the toilet. Well, in the bedroom, you can have a good rest.

                                             Чернобыль-4

          Chernobyl-4 is a city adjacent to ChAZ. Civilians, military people, including stalkers live here.
          The city is not big and you can get around it in literally 3-4 minutes. I advise you to spend an hour or two to get acquainted with the city. And I will give you very useful advice. Don’t flash your badge in the city, law enforcement agencies... will have a couple of questions for you.
          And if you still have questions about where and what is located, then I suggest you install the Discord messenger on your PDA. There, in the chat for not particularly important messages (offtopic), enter and send this link:

                                               Заработок

          After arriving in the city, you will most likely have about 2 thousand rubles left. There are several ways to earn money.
          For starters, you can work as a loader, carrying boxes from the station to the market. Or, for example, collecting bottles and selling them to the homeless Petrukha. But I think you didn’t come to the Zone to carry boxes!

          And now let’s move on to how to make money by going to the Zone. Where to go and what to go with will be written in the next chapter.
          There are many ways to make money in the Zone, but each of them is associated with certain risks and challenges. Let's look at a few of them:

        1. Stalker forays: One of the main ways to make money in the Zone is by going to its most dangerous corners in order to collect artifacts or complete tasks for customers. For successfully completing missions you can receive generous rewards.

        2. Trade: Stalkers can trade found artifacts, as well as weapons, ammunition and other valuable items. It is best to sell mutant trophies and artifacts to scientists from the research institute. Just remember that the military can search you. Be careful!

        3. Smuggling: Some stalkers engage in smuggling, transporting prohibited or rare items in the Zone. This is a risky but profitable business.
        You can buy contraband from the Buyer and sell it to Sidorovich in the Newcomer Village.

        4. Mercenary: Many factions and organizations in the Zone hire stalkers to perform various tasks - from security to eliminating competitors. This can be a reliable source of income, but also requires the execution of errands, often associated with danger.
        There are groups that engage in this type of activity (see appendix).

        5. Repair and improvement of equipment: Craftsmen -repairers can earn money by restoring and improving weapons, armor and other equipment for other stalkers

                                                    Зона

          The zone is a place that has been attracting adventurers from all over the world for several decades! When people come here, they don’t often think about the dangers they will encounter here. Many people died in its wastelands from anomalies and local fauna. And why all? Because we went to the Zone without thinking about equipment. We want to fix this.
          Here are some tips to avoid dying in the Zone:

        1. If possible, you should go in a group. You may be able to deal with one or two blind dogs, but what if there are 3 or 4 of them? Until you gain experience, you should walk in a group so that they can back you up.

        2. You should always have bolts! The anomaly could be anywhere. They make a sound, but it gives a 100% guarantee of detecting an anomaly.

        3. A radiation dosimeter should be in your pocket. There are places where radiation exceeds 4 Sv! Without a dosimeter, you may not even notice how you got into a radiation spot.

        4. For mutants, a shotgun and a bandoleer full of buckshot are best. But there are more terrible mutants, and to kill them, you will need to have a machine gun with good ammunition. They live in the north of the Zone, so they won’t threaten you in the cordon or swamps.

        5. You must have a knife! How will you fight off bushes or cut off mutant trophies? Only with a knife!

        6. Medicines. Medicines should always be available.
        Bandage, 2 sets of bruises, Dexalin tablet. AI-2 and army first aid kits will cost a little more.

        7. You should not go into the Zone at random. To begin with, it would be good to have a Zarya suit and SSh 68. If you go for artifacts, then SSP Ecologist or Seva, be sure to have a gas mask. And don’t forget about the detector, otherwise how are you going to catch these artifacts?
        Well, if you are going to a shootout, then you can’t do without body armor and a helmet. And in this case it is better to take T2-T3 cartridges.
