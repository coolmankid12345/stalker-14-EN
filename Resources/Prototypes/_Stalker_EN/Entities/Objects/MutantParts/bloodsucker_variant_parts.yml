  name: Mutated Bloodsucker Tentacles
  description: Ghostly white tentacles from an albino bloodsucker — a predator that has become one with the anomalous darkness. The bioluminescent cells along each tentacle pulse with a hypnotic rhythm. Scientists theorize this specimen could remain invisible even under direct observation. An extraordinarily dangerous trophy.

  name: Singular Bloodsucker Tentacles
  description: Golden-tinged tentacles from a bloodsucker of almost supernatural power. The tissue radiates warmth and faintly glows in darkness. Stalkers who have survived encounters with such creatures describe an overwhelming psychic pressure — as if the beast could sense their fear. These tentacles contain trace amounts of artifact-grade compounds. The scientific community would wage war over this specimen.
