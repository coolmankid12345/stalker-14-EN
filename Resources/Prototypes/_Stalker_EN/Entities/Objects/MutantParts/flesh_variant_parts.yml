  name: Adapted Flesh Eye
  description: A swollen, greenish eye from a flesh mutant that has fed extensively in anomaly-rich territories. The iris has developed an unusual bioluminescent sheen, suggesting the creature could perceive radiation spectra invisible to humans. Scientists pay a premium for specimens showing sensory adaptation.

  name: Mutated Flesh Eye
  description: A grotesque, purple-veined eye from a flesh mutant warped beyond recognition by concentrated anomaly exposure. The pupil has split into a compound structure resembling insect optics. Ecologists theorize this represents a radical evolutionary branch found only in the deepest anomaly fields.

  name: Singular Flesh Eye
  description: An enormous golden eye radiating faint warmth, harvested from a flesh mutant of mythical proportions. The lens contains microscopic artifact-like formations that refract light in impossible patterns. Stalkers who have seen such creatures claim they glow faintly in the dark. The Ecologists would kill for this specimen.
