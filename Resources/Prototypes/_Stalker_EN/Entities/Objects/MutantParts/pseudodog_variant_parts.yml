  name: Mutated Pseudodog Tail
  description: An electric-blue tail from a pseudodog whose fur crackles with residual static discharge. The creature appears to have developed a symbiotic relationship with electrical anomalies, channeling their energy through its nervous system. An extraordinary find for psionic researchers.

  name: Singular Pseudodog Tail
  description: A crimson-red tail radiating palpable heat from a pseudodog of terrifying power. Stalkers who have encountered such beasts report reality distortions in their wake — phantom images that persist long after the creature has gone. The psionic energy saturating this tissue is unlike anything documented. Worth more than most artifacts.
