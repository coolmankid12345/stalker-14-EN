# Bandit

  id: ClothingOuterJacketBandit
  name: bandit jacket
  description: A black leather jacket is a traditional attribute of bandits. Unlike the jackets worn by beginners, this one has thin metal plates sewn into it that can offer some protection from pistol rounds. It is clear that it will not withstand anomalies and machine gun fire, but in a skirmish with some newcomer it can significantly help.
